# SamFirm.NET

A streaming downloader, decryptor and extractor of Samsung firmware.

## Getting started

### Run

1. Download the executable from [Release](https://github.com/jesec/samfirm.net/releases).
1. Run it with `--region` , `--model` and `--i` arguments.
1. Region, Model and IMEI need to be valid for the target device, otherwise FUS will respond with Err 408
1. If you dont have the IMEI of a certain device you want, usually googling <model> "imei swappa" will bring up valid ones

Windows users may choose the smaller but not-self-contained variant if [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) is present.

### Build

1. Get [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
1. Open the repository with VS 2019
